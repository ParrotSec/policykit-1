    - d/p/0.113/PolkitSystemBusName-Retrieve-both-pid-and-uid.patch:
      Avoid a use of the deprecated polkit_unix_process_new()
  * d/*.symbols: Add Build-Depends-Package metadata
  * d/policykit-1.lintian-overrides: Override systemd unit false positives.
    The systemd unit is only for on-demand D-Bus activation, and is not
    intended to be started during boot, so an [Install] section and a
    parallel LSB init script are not necessary.
  * Stop building libpolkit-backend as a shared library.
    Its API was never declared stable before upstream removed it in
    0.106. Nothing in Debian depended on it, except for polkitd itself,
    which now links the same code statically.
    This is a step towards being able to use the current upstream release of
    polkit and patch in the old localauthority backend as an alternative to
    the JavaScript backend, instead of using the old 0.105 codebase and
    patching in essentially every change except the JavaScript backend,
    which is becoming unmanageable.
    - Remove the example null backend, which is pointless now that we've
      removed the ability to extend polkit.
    - Remove obsolete conffile 50-nullbackend.conf on upgrade
    - Remove the directory that previously contained 50-nullbackend.conf
      after upgrading or removing policykit-1
    - Remove obsolete dh_makeshlibs override for the null backend
  * d/policykit-1.bug-control: Add systemd, elogind versions to bug reports.
    reportbug doesn't currently seem to interpret
    "Depends: default-logind | logind" as implying that it should include
    the version number of the package that Provides logind in bug reports.
    Workaround for #934472.
  * Change the policykit-1 package from Architecture: any to
    Architecture: linux-any, and remove the consolekit [!linux-any]
    dependency. consolekit is no longer available in any Debian or
    debian-ports architecture, even those for non-Linux kernels.

  [ Martin Pitt ]
  * Use PAM's common-session-noninteractive modules for pkexec instead of
    common-session. The latter also runs pam_systemd (the only difference
    normally) which is a no-op under the classic session-centric
    D-BUS/graphical login model (as it won't start a new one if it is already
    running within a logind session), but very expensive when using
    dbus-user-session and being called from a service that runs outside the
    PAM session. This causes long delays in e. g. gnome-settings-daemon's
    backlight helpers. (LP: #1626651)

    environments. (Closes: #671497)
